A project based on the Fullstack-Javascript Curriculum of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

In this project, I learned about:

    1. Clean code (usage of indentation, camelCase, naming Conventions, etc.);
    2. Fundamentals of Javascript (Arrays, Loops, and introduction Test Driven Development);
    3. DOM Manipulation.
